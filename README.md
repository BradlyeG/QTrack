QTrack
======

Asset management system whose goal is to be best at keeping asset data safe, sorted, and quick to retrieve. 

The application will be based in Java, allowing for complete cross platform utilization with no extra steps to the end user required. The application will support a MySQL database, and utilize the Java Database Connection API to handle the communication, and the Google Zxing to read barcodes, and QRCodes.

This project is defining an asset as a computer device used within some kind of a corporation, maybe a school system or a workplace. The idea is that the technician will scan a barcode or QRCode, this brings up a “document” that shows basic statistics of the device, and any issues that are tagged with that device.
