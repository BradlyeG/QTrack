QTrack
======

Asset management system based on java, managed and hosted locally.

Based on a proven platform and leveraging completely free, cross platform, and architecture independent technology, the QTrack AMS (asset management system) aims to be simple to use, and simple to set up. This project is comepltely free and open source, on the technical side of things, the project aims to work on every architecture java runs on, from the powerpc iMacs of the early 2000s, to the x86-x64 cpus released yesterday.

From an administration standpoint, it is rather easy to setup, simply create a database, host it, and enter the serial numbers. The application itself will handle the rest of the workload, creating all the profiles and associated data with each device.
